Q: `algorithm to determine labor day date`

A:
```
Hereâ€™s a simple algorithm to determine the date of Labor Day (U.S.) for any given year:
Definition:
Labor Day in the United States is observed on the first Monday in September.

ðŸ§® Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

Input: year
Output: Date of Labor Day for that year

Set month = 9 (September).

Set day = 1 (start from September 1).

Find the day of the week for September 1 of that year.

Letâ€™s call it dow (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, â€¦, 6 = Saturday).

Compute offset:

offset = (8 - dow) % 7


This calculates how many days to add to reach the next Monday (if Sept 1 is Monday, offset = 0).

Labor Day = September 1 + offset days.

ðŸ’» Example in Pseudocode
function getLaborDay(year):
date = September 1 of given year
dow = dayOfWeek(date)  # Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6
offset = (8 - dow) % 7
laborDay = date + offset days
return laborDay

ðŸ§  Example

For 2025:

Sept 1, 2025 â†’ Monday (dow = 1)

offset = (8 - 1) % 7 = 0

Labor Day = September 1, 2025

âœ… Result: September 1, 2025
```

Q: `algorithm to get number of weekend days in a date range`

A:
```
Hereâ€™s a clear and efficient algorithm to determine the number of weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays) between two dates (inclusive).

ðŸ§® Algorithm: Count Weekend Days in a Date Range

Input:

startDate

endDate (inclusive or exclusiveâ€”see note below)

Output:

Number of weekend days in the range.

Step-by-Step Logic

Ensure order
If startDate > endDate, swap them.

Compute total days

totalDays = (endDate - startDate).days + 1


Compute number of full weeks

fullWeeks = totalDays // 7
weekendDays = fullWeeks * 2


Because each full week contains exactly 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

Handle the remaining days

remainingDays = totalDays % 7
startDayOfWeek = dayOfWeek(startDate)  # 0=Monday, 6=Sunday


Loop through leftover days
For each i from 0 to remainingDays - 1:

if (startDayOfWeek + i) % 7 in {5, 6}:   # Saturday=5, Sunday=6
    weekendDays += 1


Return weekendDays

Pseudocode
function countWeekendDays(startDate, endDate):
    if startDate > endDate:
        swap(startDate, endDate)

    totalDays = (endDate - startDate).days + 1
    fullWeeks = totalDays // 7
    weekendDays = fullWeeks * 2

    remainingDays = totalDays % 7
    startDayOfWeek = dayOfWeek(startDate)  # Monday=0, Sunday=6

    for i in 0 .. remainingDays - 1:
        if ((startDayOfWeek + i) % 7) in [5, 6]:
            weekendDays += 1

    return weekendDays

Example

Range: 2025-10-01 (Wednesday) â†’ 2025-10-18 (Saturday)

totalDays = 18

fullWeeks = 2 â†’ 2 Ã— 2 = 4 weekend days

remainingDays = 4 (Wed â†’ Sat)

Wed (2), Thu (3), Fri (4), Sat (5 â†’ weekend)

weekendDays = 4 + 1 = 5 weekend days

âœ… Result: 5 weekend days
```

Q: `Math.round a decimal to the nearest hundredth in java`

A:

```
In Java, to round a decimal to the nearest hundredth (two decimal places), you can use several approaches. Here are the most common and reliable ones ðŸ‘‡

âœ… 1. Using Math.round() with scaling

Math.round() works on whole numbers, so you multiply, round, then divide back.

double value = 3.14159;
double rounded = Math.round(value * 100.0) / 100.0;
System.out.println(rounded);  // â†’ 3.14


Explanation:

Multiply by 100 to shift two decimal places.

Round to nearest integer.

Divide by 100.0 to shift back to two decimal places.

âœ… 2. Using BigDecimal (best for precise decimal rounding)

If youâ€™re dealing with currency or require exact decimal control, use BigDecimal.

import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.math.RoundingMode;

double value = 3.14159;
double rounded = new BigDecimal(value)
        .setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)
        .doubleValue();

System.out.println(rounded);  // â†’ 3.14


Advantages:

More precise (avoids floating-point rounding issues).

Can specify rounding mode (HALF_UP, HALF_DOWN, HALF_EVEN, etc.).

âœ… 3. Using String.format() (for display only)

If you just need it formatted to two decimals (not mathematically rounded for further computation):

double value = 3.14159;
System.out.println(String.format("%.2f", value));  
```
