There were a handful of instances where I prompted AI. I find that AI does really well with simpler questions, more research topics than anything else. I needed clarification on a couple of the algorithms for the holidays, some clarification on BigDecimal rounding, and some clarification on Injecting mocks.

Prompt: `algorithm to determine labor day date`

Response:
```
Here‚Äôs a simple algorithm to determine the date of Labor Day (U.S.) for any given year:
Definition:
Labor Day in the United States is observed on the first Monday in September.

üßÆ Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

Input: year
Output: Date of Labor Day for that year

Set month = 9 (September).

Set day = 1 (start from September 1).

Find the day of the week for September 1 of that year.

Let‚Äôs call it dow (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ‚Ä¶, 6 = Saturday).

Compute offset:

offset = (8 - dow) % 7


This calculates how many days to add to reach the next Monday (if Sept 1 is Monday, offset = 0).

Labor Day = September 1 + offset days.

üíª Example in Pseudocode
function getLaborDay(year):
date = September 1 of given year
dow = dayOfWeek(date)  # Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6
offset = (8 - dow) % 7
laborDay = date + offset days
return laborDay

üß† Example

For 2025:

Sept 1, 2025 ‚Üí Monday (dow = 1)

offset = (8 - 1) % 7 = 0

Labor Day = September 1, 2025

‚úÖ Result: September 1, 2025
```

Prompt: `algorithm to get number of weekend days in a date range`

Response:
```
Here‚Äôs a clear and efficient algorithm to determine the number of weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays) between two dates (inclusive).

üßÆ Algorithm: Count Weekend Days in a Date Range

Input:

startDate

endDate (inclusive or exclusive‚Äîsee note below)

Output:

Number of weekend days in the range.

Step-by-Step Logic

Ensure order
If startDate > endDate, swap them.

Compute total days

totalDays = (endDate - startDate).days + 1


Compute number of full weeks

fullWeeks = totalDays // 7
weekendDays = fullWeeks * 2


Because each full week contains exactly 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

Handle the remaining days

remainingDays = totalDays % 7
startDayOfWeek = dayOfWeek(startDate)  # 0=Monday, 6=Sunday


Loop through leftover days
For each i from 0 to remainingDays - 1:

if (startDayOfWeek + i) % 7 in {5, 6}:   # Saturday=5, Sunday=6
    weekendDays += 1


Return weekendDays

Pseudocode
function countWeekendDays(startDate, endDate):
    if startDate > endDate:
        swap(startDate, endDate)

    totalDays = (endDate - startDate).days + 1
    fullWeeks = totalDays // 7
    weekendDays = fullWeeks * 2

    remainingDays = totalDays % 7
    startDayOfWeek = dayOfWeek(startDate)  # Monday=0, Sunday=6

    for i in 0 .. remainingDays - 1:
        if ((startDayOfWeek + i) % 7) in [5, 6]:
            weekendDays += 1

    return weekendDays

Example

Range: 2025-10-01 (Wednesday) ‚Üí 2025-10-18 (Saturday)

totalDays = 18

fullWeeks = 2 ‚Üí 2 √ó 2 = 4 weekend days

remainingDays = 4 (Wed ‚Üí Sat)

Wed (2), Thu (3), Fri (4), Sat (5 ‚Üí weekend)

weekendDays = 4 + 1 = 5 weekend days

‚úÖ Result: 5 weekend days
```

Prompt: `Math.round a decimal to the nearest hundredth in java`

Response:

```
In Java, to round a decimal to the nearest hundredth (two decimal places), you can use several approaches. Here are the most common and reliable ones üëá

‚úÖ 1. Using Math.round() with scaling

Math.round() works on whole numbers, so you multiply, round, then divide back.

double value = 3.14159;
double rounded = Math.round(value * 100.0) / 100.0;
System.out.println(rounded);  // ‚Üí 3.14


Explanation:

Multiply by 100 to shift two decimal places.

Round to nearest integer.

Divide by 100.0 to shift back to two decimal places.

‚úÖ 2. Using BigDecimal (best for precise decimal rounding)

If you‚Äôre dealing with currency or require exact decimal control, use BigDecimal.

import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.math.RoundingMode;

double value = 3.14159;
double rounded = new BigDecimal(value)
        .setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)
        .doubleValue();

System.out.println(rounded);  // ‚Üí 3.14


Advantages:

More precise (avoids floating-point rounding issues).

Can specify rounding mode (HALF_UP, HALF_DOWN, HALF_EVEN, etc.).

‚úÖ 3. Using String.format() (for display only)

If you just need it formatted to two decimals (not mathematically rounded for further computation):

double value = 3.14159;
System.out.println(String.format("%.2f", value));  
```
Prompt: `java junit inject mocks`

Response:
```
In JUnit (with Mockito), you use @Mock and @InjectMocks annotations to automatically create mock dependencies and inject them into the class under test. Here‚Äôs how it works:

‚úÖ Example Setup
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations;

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class PaymentServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private PaymentGateway paymentGateway;

    @InjectMocks
    private PaymentService paymentService; // Class under test

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);
    }

    @Test
    void testProcessPayment() {
        when(paymentGateway.charge(anyDouble())).thenReturn(true);

        boolean result = paymentService.processPayment(100.0);

        assertTrue(result);
        verify(paymentGateway).charge(100.0);
    }
}

üß© How it Works

@Mock ‚Äî creates a mock object of the given type (e.g., PaymentGateway).

@InjectMocks ‚Äî creates an instance of the class under test (e.g., PaymentService) and injects any fields annotated with @Mock that match by type.

MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this) ‚Äî initializes the annotations before each test (or use @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) for JUnit 5).

‚úÖ JUnit 5 Simplified Version

Instead of calling MockitoAnnotations.openMocks, you can use the Mockito extension:

import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;

@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class PaymentServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private PaymentGateway paymentGateway;

    @InjectMocks
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    @Test
    void testProcessPayment() {
        when(paymentGateway.charge(100.0)).thenReturn(true);

        assertTrue(paymentService.processPayment(100.0));
        verify(paymentGateway).charge(100.0);
    }
}

‚öôÔ∏è Injection Behavior

@InjectMocks tries the following in order:

Constructor injection (if there‚Äôs exactly one constructor).

Setter injection (for any setter methods).

Field injection (as a fallback).
